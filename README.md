# DAT240_exam_project
This repository contains the exam project I, together with 4 other students, made for the university course DAT240 - Advanced Programming.
We were tasked with making an application for an image guessing game complete with multiplayer, leaderboards, lobbies and such.
The repository contains videos that I made showcasing the application. I suggest watching the create_game_singleplayer_suggest_tiles_leaderboard.mp4 video first.

The .zip file was too big for GitHub (0,7GB) so here is the link to the exam project on Google Drive:

I developed most of the frontend and a lot of the game's logic. I also helped out a bit here and there. Of course, I had some help from the others sometime too. Still, everybody had their responsibilities regarding the development of the apllication.
