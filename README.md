# DAT240_exam_project
This repository contains the exam project I, together with 4 other students, made for the university course DAT240 - Advanced Programming.

The .zip file was too big for GitHub (0,7GB) so here is the link to the exam project on Google Drive:

We were tasked with making an application for an image guessing game complete with multiplayer, leaderboards, lobbies and such.
